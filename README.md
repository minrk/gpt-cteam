[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/minrk/gpt-cteam/master?filepath=generating-cteam-transcripts.ipynb)

This notebook uses [GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) to generate transcripts of the "C" team based on the transcripts of existing episodes.

For when you have run out of real episodes, and need to generate an infinite number of new ones!

Model trained [on colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Up9uwclJ4wYm9MFJhoI0_BNBqPeuY-vb), derived from [this example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VLG8e7YSEwypxU-noRNhsv5dW4NfTGce) by [Max Woolf](http://minimaxir.com/).

Training data was available manual transcripts from YouTube videos for [The "C" Team](http://www.acq-inc.com/cteam), which is only the first six episodes, plus Anchors Aweigh part 2.
